# emacs-fast
A fast configuration of EMacs.

This EMacs configuration aims to be fast to load and does not includes
a lot of bells and whistle. I plan to add sane defaults for these
languages

- C++
- MATLAB
- LATEX

The project will expand as I add more configuration. Feel free to
clone and build on this initial configuration.
